      <description>Sabbatical Plan I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break from full-time work for at least a few weeks, probably a few months.
While we&amp;rsquo;re far from early retirement, Christina and I have saved enough money to support this temporary venture into voluntary unemployment. And based on the current demand for experienced professionals in both our respective fields, we are confident that both of us will find suitable and profitable work when we choose to pursue it, barring an economic paradigm shift large enough to displace other skilled workers who hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken a sabbatical.</description>
