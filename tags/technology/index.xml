      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that the most successful apps, games, and social media platforms dedicate considerable effort into making their product addictive. If they don&amp;rsquo;t, consumers would be less likely to use their product, making it less valuable to advertisers.
60 Minutes presented a segment back in 2018 titled &amp;ldquo;Brain Hacking&amp;rdquo; (link) that explained how intentional these addictive features are.
The NIH published an article in 2019, listing several common &amp;ldquo;psychological mechanisms&amp;rdquo; that are built into social media and other smartphone apps (link).</description>

      <description>I constantly think of software, data, and other technical components of my job in terms of analogies. It&amp;rsquo;s a great teaching mechanism, particularly for visual learners such as myself.
Analogies have greatly impacted terminology in software for a long time. Data pipelines are so named as information &amp;ldquo;flows&amp;rdquo; from a source to a destination. Neural networks, and their building blocks called perceptrons, are named after neurological terminology since the design of these structures was inspired by the brain.</description>

      <description>UI has an innate ability to instill a variety of emotions in users. A dashboard full of green-background rows invokes satisfaction. A single red exclamation mark icon amidst a sea of green checkmarks should draw attention to itself like a bad spy behind enemy lines and serve as a nuisance to the user like a popcorn kernel stuck in their gums.
Bad passwords, old passwords, and re-used passwords SHOULD bother users.</description>

ZSH oh-my-zsh and its benefits
~/.zsh_aliases Homebrew (Mac) /bin/bash -c &amp;#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)&amp;#34; Python 3 Python 2 is dead, but Mac can&amp;rsquo;t let it go yet.
Cut in line by adding a symlink to python3:
brew install python ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python python2 is already an alias for you, so on the off-chance you actually want to run python 2 for something, you can still access it</description>

      <description>Everything now is data-driven. E-commerce vendors that can&amp;rsquo;t accurately make personalized product recommendations will inevitably fail to compete with those that can. Successful political campaigns rely on polling data and other quantified public sentiment in order to determine into which states and demographics are worth investing time and money.
This is not a new phenomenon: only a new buzzword.
&amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; is just information. Commercial enterprises have always needed to know what products are worth building and what services are worth offering.</description>

      <description>Most companies and products have their own &amp;ldquo;tech stack&amp;rdquo; or list of technologies they use in their proprietary tools. As a pro user, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for ways to enable the most capabilities, speed up my workflow, and - ideally - find free ways to do so.
