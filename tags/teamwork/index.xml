      <description>Opportunity for True Teamwork Who&amp;rsquo;s to blame when an AI-driven tool does something bad?
VW GTI diesel scandal: executive blamed a &amp;ldquo;rogue engineer&amp;rdquo;
MIT Moral Machine
Lots of complaints about billionaires profiting off their employees (what boss doesn&amp;rsquo;t, btw?) and not taking enough responsibility while fostering a false &amp;ldquo;when you&amp;rsquo;re here, you&amp;rsquo;re family&amp;rdquo; work environment.
Let&amp;rsquo;s keep AI a team sport.
Racial bias is all over the news nowadays. While we should be reporting on the incredible potential for AI to address global-scale problems, we&amp;rsquo;re instead trying to fix false positives in facial recognition software that misidentifies black people more often than white people.</description>

      <description>Exploring the magic black box of .git
What happened and when? When something breaks, and you have no idea where to start, try a manual binary search through the git log.
 something is currently broken we don&amp;rsquo;t know when it broke / when it last worked  What to do
 git log --pretty=format:&amp;quot;%ci | %h&amp;quot; --no-merges -- tools/ui-ide/package.json Start at middle commit ID check out commit ID and run whatever idempotent script you need to put comment next to commit ID If it works, pick commit ID halfway between that one and last-tried future commit (or latest commit) If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, pick commit ID halfway between that one and last-tried past commit (or first commit) Repeat from step 3 with new commit ID  Once this is done, you&amp;rsquo;ll have determined which commit ID broke everything and you can blame the developer who created that commit</description>

      <title>Knowledge Sharing</title>

      <description>If I ran the zoo&amp;hellip; Knowledge sharing is difficult. Everywhere. And it&amp;rsquo;s because everyone, EVERYONE, writes their own &amp;ldquo;notes to self,&amp;rdquo; bookmarked links, and custom local &amp;ldquo;one-off&amp;rdquo; scripts.
 Can&amp;rsquo;t we just have them put those on Confluence/Wiki/Teams/Slack/GitHub/Community/code documentation/Sharepoint?
 First off, pick a damn &amp;ldquo;single source of truth,&amp;rdquo; you can&amp;rsquo;t have 12 of them.
Secondly, we could try, but no one will. That stems from much more deeply-seated problems: impostor syndrome, self-doubt, and fear of judgment.</description>
