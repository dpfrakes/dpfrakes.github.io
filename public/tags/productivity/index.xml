      <description>Binaries Node Version Manager NVM
ZSH oh-my-zsh and its benefits
~/.zsh_aliases Homebrew (Mac) /bin/bash -c &amp;#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)&amp;#34; Python 3 Python 2 is dead, but Mac can&amp;rsquo;t let it go yet.
Cut in line by adding a symlink to python3:
brew install python ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python python2 is already an alias for you, so on the off-chance you actually want to run python 2 for something, you can still access it</description>

      <description>Most companies and products have their own &amp;ldquo;tech stack&amp;rdquo; or list of technologies they use in their proprietary tools. As a pro user, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for ways to enable the most capabilities, speed up my workflow, and - ideally - find free ways to do so.

      <description>Exploring the magic black box of .git
What happened and when? When something breaks, and you have no idea where to start, try a manual binary search through the git log.
 something is currently broken we don&amp;rsquo;t know when it broke / when it last worked  What to do
 git log --pretty=format:&amp;quot;%ci | %h&amp;quot; --no-merges -- tools/ui-ide/package.json Start at middle commit ID check out commit ID and run whatever idempotent script you need to put comment next to commit ID If it works, pick commit ID halfway between that one and last-tried future commit (or latest commit) If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, pick commit ID halfway between that one and last-tried past commit (or first commit) Repeat from step 3 with new commit ID  Once this is done, you&amp;rsquo;ll have determined which commit ID broke everything and you can blame the developer who created that commit</description>

      <description>I have way too many browser bookmarks, but there is one folder of bookmarks I use regularly: bookmarklets.
Just as you can save an HTML webpage as a bookmark, you can also save Javascript script as a bookmarklet, basically turning your bookmarks bar into a control panel.
javascript:(function(){alert(&amp;#39;hello!&amp;#39;)})() caption: a very basic javascript snippet
Caution: make sure you know exactly what the bookmarklet is going to do before you run it or add it to your bookmarks bar.</description>

      <description>Practice In music:
 &amp;ldquo;One must practice slowly, then more slowly, and finally slowly.&amp;rdquo;
–Camille Saint-Saens
 In woodworking:
 &amp;ldquo;Measure twice, cut once.&amp;rdquo;
–Anonymous
 In programming:
 &amp;ldquo;Programming is a skill best acquired by practice and example rather than from books.&amp;rdquo;
–Alan Turing
 Practice is a Lost Art My Dad has a fairly cynical sense of humor which is likely the source of his interest in &amp;ldquo;trollable&amp;rdquo; axioms.</description>
