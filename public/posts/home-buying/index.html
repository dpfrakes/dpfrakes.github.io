    <div>
        <p>
        <h2 id="what-we-did">What We Did</h2>
<p>First, we budgeted. We planned for single income, and decided to be
conservative in calculating our home affordability because we know the
likelihood of unexpected cheap or free stuff is a lot lower than unexpected
costs and fees.</p>
<p>Then, we discussed location (at length), evaluating location options using the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P2aFMfTXII">Ted Mosby Pros &amp; Cons Method</a>.
It really boiled down to family and church being our biggest priorities, at
the expense of cost-of-living and traffic. A quieter, more rural lifestyle may
still be in our future, but we decided now is not the time for that.</p>
<p>Once we had a budget and general idea of geography, we started scouring Redfin
and Zillow. I actually quite enjoy window shopping online, figuring out
floorplans and layouts based on a few photos, and gathering data on what makes
a home &ldquo;good&rdquo; (e.g. square footage, open layout, proximity to stores, a
relatively flat yard).</p>
<p>We had recently gotten to know a member at our church who happens to be a
realtor, so we decided to ask her to help us look for a home. Until we are
more experienced and comfortable with the whole property-buying process, we
believe using an agent is the safest bet, especially as a buyer.</p>

<p>Friday 3/4
??????? Saw listing online as coming soon with open house on Saturday</p>
<p>Saturday 3/5</p>
<ul>
<li>1:00pm The listing goes live with an open house in the afternoon. We tour it and love it. While at the open house, we ask the listing agent if they&rsquo;ve received offers, and when they plan on reviewing offers. She informs us nothing yet since it&rsquo;s fresh on the market, but if they receive offers, they plan on reviewing Monday night and deciding Tuesday.</li>
<li>5:00pm We let our agent know that we&rsquo;re interested in making an offer (she was unavailable for tours/open houses that day), and she got in touch with the listing agent later that night to get the latest info.</li>
<li>9:00pm Our agent set up a phone call with us and her senior colleague for Sunday morning to discuss our offer parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sunday 3/6</p>
<ul>
<li>11:00am We have our phone call meeting after church, where we discuss offer amount, escalation clause, the seller&rsquo;s rent back, pre-offer inspections, and contingencies. We were convinced by Heather to waive all contingencies (financing, appraisal, inspection) and offer free rent-back (she said all rent back situations in the current market are being offered as free). Our agent agreed to set up a pre-offer home inspection for our own benefit and at our own cost. We scheduled it for same day since offers were due the following day.</li>
<li>12:30pm We headed over to my parents&rsquo; for brunch.</li>
<li>1:00pm Our agent texted us with quotes for full inspection, walk-and-talk, and termite inspection. We decided to go with the walk-and-talk since it would be all the same info and we can save $120 by taking notes ourselves as our &ldquo;written report&rdquo; (the only difference) and get the state-required termite inspection.</li>
<li>2:00pm I received, read, and signed the inspection agreement documents and paid online.</li>
<li>5:45pm We brought Dad along to meet our agent, who brought her daughter, and the inspector, Bob Egan, at the property. Bob was 10-15 minutes late, but was quick, thorough, informative, and very knowledgable about brands, regulations, options, and recommendations. He seemed very impressed with the quality of the home and said there were no red flags other than one very simple safety fix of adding a padlock to the open fuse box.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monday 3/7</p>
<ul>
<li>9:30am Our agent called our loan officer to discuss loan amount, contingencies, and closing time frame.</li>
<li>10:00am Our agent emailed me to inform us of the earliest close date available (3/28) and confirm earnest money, down payment, and loan amount.</li>
<li>12:30pm Our agent texted with an update after calling the listing agent again for latest info: They are expecting 8 other offers, an earlier close date is better, and we might want to rethink our escalation strategy to use an odd number to avoid ties/unnecessary escalation. We agreed to bump our base offer from $685k to $695k and escalate up to a maximum of $705k.</li>
<li>1:45pm Our agent called me back to check in after discussing the escalation strategy with her colleague. They decided we should pick an odd number for escalation increments instead of common round numbers like $1k. After the call, our agent updated the contract with earliest possible close date (March 28), our increased base offer ($695k), and updated escalation increment ($1609).</li>
<li>2:00pm She sent us the final contract via DocuSign, and we sent our final letter to the owners along with our signed offer.</li>
<li>4:00pm Our agent emailed our loan officer to request she call the listing agent to put in a good word for us with regard to solid financing. Our loan officer does and we all thank her.</li>
<li>5:00pm Offer deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuesday 3/8</p>
<ul>
<li>12:00pm Our agent texted to let us know that she just called the listing agent to check in. The listing agent was meeting with the sellers at the time.</li>
<li>2:30pm Our agent called with the bad news that we didn&rsquo;t get the house. She didn&rsquo;t have any further info on other offers, including the winning bid, but said she&rsquo;d keep her ear to the ground and let us know as soon as she learned any more. We told her we&rsquo;d be on a family trip and therefore be taking a break this weekend from house-hunting. She asked us to update our favorites on her portal for her benefit, which we did.</li>

<li>We see the listing as &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; and love it, but are pessimistic about it going for anywhere near its list price of $640k</li>
<li>We set up a showing anyway for ASAP</li>
<li>Our agent lets us know that there&rsquo;s already interest, including one offer &ldquo;site unseen&rdquo; for an unknown amount. The listing agent gives the impression that the winning bid will start with a &ldquo;7&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>We go to our showing without Bob</li>
<li>We still like it but are still pessimistic we&rsquo;d be competitive enough</li>
<li>Our agent calls the listing agent and leaves another voicemail right after our showing to ask about current offers in hand, any offer deadline, and request a ballpark range</li>
<li>We decide to go ahead with our best offer anyway of $700k with an escalation to $710k</li>
<li>We draft a letter to the sellers based on our previous 2 letters. We add a photo of us from our wedding and a photo of our baby</li>
<li>Our agent was still waiting for the Seller&rsquo;s Disclosure and so didn&rsquo;t have a completed offer draft for us to sign yet</li>

<ul>
<li>8:00am Our agent texts to ask if we have a letter to the sellers ready.</li>
<li>10:00am We confirm we do and she sends us the sellers&rsquo; names to update our address line. We update the letter and send over</li>
<li>10:30am We review the offer our agent sent us and sign it. She also asks us to send a photo of a check showing our earnest deposit amount (which we could void in favor of a wire transfer later). We write the check and send her a photo of it.</li>
<li>11:00am Offer submitted</li>
<li>3:30pm The listing agent emails our agent to inform her that they&rsquo;d be reviewing offers that night.</li>
<li>9:30pm Our agent texts us to let us know there are 11 offers, but that we were in the running with a strong offer. Our lender also spoke with the listing agent as well and had a &ldquo;good conversation.&rdquo;</li>
<li>11:15pm Our agent texts again to let us know she was on the phone, that we were currently &ldquo;tied,&rdquo; and that $712k might seal the deal. She calls and we approve the offer increase. She forwards the counter-offer from the listing agent which we initial. It also includes a correction regarding the hot water heater (initially listed as gas but corrected to electric).</li>
<li>12:00am We panic, celebrate, talk, and panic some more. I download all the MLS listing photos I could find. I had started to crunch some numbers but it&rsquo;s 1:30am before I know it and we go to bed.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>2pm - I realize there might be a problem in the loan application regarding employment verification. The application includes a clause that states that the buyer(s) verify that employment information is up to date and there is no expectation for employment status to change before closing. Christina had let her company know that 4/1 (that day) was her last, so she was planning on going into the office this afternoon to clear out her desk and return her badge. I let Christina know and we call Elizabeth to ask about this. She gets Jordan involved quickly and we ask about changing the application to just have me as the borrower and take Christina off as co-borrower. Jordan says this would likely mean going back to underwriting and cause us to miss our closing date, so Christina would need to stay employed. We spend the entire afternoon trying to get ahold of her supervisor.</p>
<p>4:30pm - After 2 voicemails and multiple emails, Christina&rsquo;s supervisor finally calls back, apologizing that her cell service must&rsquo;ve been bad because she just got the voicemails. She makes some calls to HR and asks Christina how much longer she would stay. We thank her profusely, apologize for pestering with such a unique request on such short notice, and confirm 4/15 as her new last day. Christina&rsquo;s government supervisor emails the team to let them know she&rsquo;d be staying on a little longer. I finally unclench my jaw and thank God for answering my earlier prayers.</p>
<p>4/3</p>
<p>7pm - Elizabeth calls me while we&rsquo;re at my parents&rsquo; for dinner. She informs me that Bob is available 1:30pm on Friday for termite and house inspection, and that I could text her back in the morning to let her know if we wanted a walk-and-talk or a full inspection report. She also asks if a particular time would work better for us for closing and that the sellers may do an &ldquo;early closing&rdquo; where they sign the documents on another day ahead of 4/14. I ask about the earnest money deposit and she says she got confirmation from the title company that the money was on its way.</p>
<p>4/4</p>
<p>9am - Glen from Guaranteed Rate Insurance calls to ask some questions so he could get an insurance quote. I&rsquo;d seen his email on Saturday but hadn&rsquo;t gotten back yet. I answer his questions (any recent insurance claims? own a dog?) and he sends me a quote within the hour.
10am - I review the insurance quote and email Glen with some clarifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should it be 2 stories instead of 1.5?</li>
<li>Should garage be included as 1-car garage?</li>
</ol>
<p>He emails me back almost immediately and says that due to the square footage of the 2nd floor, it counts as a half-story. He also says that since it is not used as a garage (not car-accessible), the attached garage is included in his quote as an unfinished portion of the basement.</p>
<p>1pm - I call USAA to ask about the wire transfer status since our checking account balance hadn&rsquo;t changed yet, and the agent says it wouldn&rsquo;t be a wire transfer if it was initiated from someone other than USAA, so naturally I panic again. He says it might be an ACH transfer but that&rsquo;s unlikely for real estate transactions, and he offers to stay on the line while I call the title company. I put him on hold and call RGS Title to ask how the earnest money deposit works, and the receptionist says I had executed an ACH transfer within the 2 day time period required and that the only other task I would&rsquo;ve needed to do was signing any forms in the RGS portal (which I&rsquo;d done prior to the ACH transfer). I thank her, return to my USAA call, and explain that it was, in fact, an ACH transfer. He says that&rsquo;s pretty fancy for a title company to be able to do that and asks if that means there would be a future wire transfer for the remaining down payment. I tell him that would be via Christina&rsquo;s savings account, so no. I think I&rsquo;ve lost a year off my life over the past 4 days.</p>
<p>4/5</p>
<p>10am - Glen calls back to ask if I had any other questions about the insurance quote. I tell him no and he says he would send it along to Travelers and that I should be hearing from Travelers directly, probably some time tomorrow, to sign the agreement and pay for the insurance.</p>
<p>10:45am - I log into USAA to check if the earnest money deposit went through, and it looks like it did! At this point, Christina and I should only have a few more tasks on our end:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign homeowner&rsquo;s insurance documents from Travelers and pay any premium due at signing</li>
<li>Go to home inspection on Friday</li>
<li>Schedule wire transfer for remaining down payment + closing costs (expecting instructions from Jordan/Guaranteed Rate)</li>
<li>Sign a mountain of paperwork at closing and receive our key</li>
</ul>

<p>CONTACT JORDAN: 4506-C #2 missing signature field? do I need to sign both?</p>

<p>4pm - Amy Cullen sends &ldquo;Conditional Loan Approval&rdquo; email, requiring more signatures. Borrower conditions outlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Documentation subject to acceptance by Guaranteed Rate, Inc</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a finalized homeowners insurance policy</li>
<li>Signed and dated credit inquiry explanation</li>
<li>Provide most recent PNC mortgage statement</li>
<li>Provide most recent Bank of America statement</li>
<li>Provide purchase price escalation addendum</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>7pm - Elizabeth calls to let us know that the buyers would like us to wait until after closing date to do the walk-and-talk inspection. Christina and I aren&rsquo;t happy about this since it feels like one more stipulation causing us to bend over backwards for an already-sweet deal, or worst-case: they&rsquo;re hiding a major issue with the house. I don&rsquo;t want any more paperwork or friction to slow or put at risk our closing, so we agree to reschedule the inspection. The termite inspection is already happening (required by law) even though the outcome will have absolutely no impact on contractual obligations of either party. We already scheduled and paid for both inspections at the same time, so it seems shady. While on the phone, I ask if she had heard from Jordan or already provided Guaranteed Rate with the price escalation addendum. She says she hasn&rsquo;t checked email in a while but will follow up.</p>
<p>11pm - Initiate transfer (ACH) of $5000 from USAA to Ally (USAA limits online transfers to $5k).</p>
<p>4/6</p>
<p>10am - AI trade settled this morning, so I initiate the transfer of cash ($16,440) from Schwab to Ally. The transfer should complete within 1-2 days.</p>
<p>3pm - I still haven&rsquo;t seen any further correspondence from US Inspect regarding rescheduling, so I text Elizabeth to ask if we need to call. They have a $100 cancelation fee if we cancel/reschedule within 24 hours of our appointment, and I&rsquo;m not paying extra to cancel an inspection I don&rsquo;t even want to postpone. I also confirm that Ally has received the $5k transfer from USAA, so the account balance is now $117,127.97. According to the most recent loan estimate from Guaranteed Rate, the estimated cost due from us at closing is $160,562 (less $30k earnest money deposit). The Schwab transfer should be the last movement of money prior to our down payment wire just prior to closing.</p>
<p>4pm - Elizabeth replies, stating that she spoke with US Inspect and that we&rsquo;re confirmed for 1:30 termite inspection, she has tentatively scheduled them for June 1 for walk-and-talk inspection, and that there is no additional fees. She also emails us utility information she received from the sellers&rsquo; agent on 4/1 which includes paperwork for transfer and activation of services.</p>
<p>4/7</p>
<p>9:30am - I confirm that Schwab transfer has completed and Ally savings account now has $133,568.21</p>
<p>2pm - Jordan texts me and says she is having trouble getting ahold of someone from my company&rsquo;s HR to confirm my employment. She asks if I have any personal contact information in my company&rsquo;s HR department, and I send along the name, phone, and email of my HR manager (Nicki Perkins) and the head of HR (Sharon Robey).</p>
<p>4/8</p>
<p>10:30am - We receive the closing disclosure from Guaranteed Rate, review it, and sign. This mentions an even lower closing cost estimate ($14,488) than the original estimate ($18,162).</p>
<p>12pm - Elizabeth calls to inform me that Bob is in the neighborhood of our new house and has offered to conduct the termite inspection early. We agree that as long as the time change works for the sellers, Bob can go alone to conduct the termite inspection, and we&rsquo;ll just plan on bringing our tape measure to the final walkthrough on closing day.</p>
<p>2:30pm - We haven&rsquo;t heard back, so I assume Bob went ahead with the termite inspection early. I plan on texting Elizabeth to confirm this evening if we still haven&rsquo;t heard from her or US Inspect.</p>
<p>4/10</p>
<p>8am - Jordan texts me, requesting that I schedule the closing with RGS Title.</p>
<p>8:30am - I text Elizabeth with this and ask if there is a time that works best for her. She replies stating that she hasn&rsquo;t heard from the listing agent since Friday regarding when we can do a walkthrough of the property on closing day but that 12p or 1p should be fine.</p>
<p>8:45am - I call RGS Title to book a closing appointment, and there is one time slot left at 2:30pm. The title company says usually the real estate agent calls to schedule closings since they need to be sure they are available then as well, but since this is the last time slot, she pencils us in and says she will confirm with our agent.</p>
<p>We receive final loan approval (&ldquo;clear to close&rdquo;) email from our lender; no signatures required.</p>
<p>4pm - We receive our FlashClose closing documents via email from our lender. We have until closing day to review and sign all documents provided, then we will need to sign the remaining documents - those that require a notary present - in person on closing day at the title company&rsquo;s office. I start to review these documents immediately.</p>
<p>4/14 - Closing Day</p>
<p>12am - We get an email from Guaranteed Rate stating that our FlashClose documents are ready for signatures.</p>
<p>8:30am - We meet Elizabeth at the property and being our walk-through. She gives us the key from the lockbox to keep.</p>
<p>2:30pm - We go to the</p>
