      <description>Opportunity for True Teamwork Who&amp;rsquo;s to blame when an AI-driven tool does something bad?
VW GTI diesel scandal: executive blamed a &amp;ldquo;rogue engineer&amp;rdquo;
MIT Moral Machine
Lots of complaints about billionaires profiting off their employees (what boss doesn&amp;rsquo;t, btw?) and not taking enough responsibility while fostering a false &amp;ldquo;when you&amp;rsquo;re here, you&amp;rsquo;re family&amp;rdquo; work environment.
Let&amp;rsquo;s keep AI a team sport.
Racial bias is all over the news nowadays. While we should be reporting on the incredible potential for AI to address global-scale problems, we&amp;rsquo;re instead trying to fix false positives in facial recognition software that misidentifies black people more often than white people.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that the most successful apps, games, and social media platforms dedicate considerable effort into making their product addictive. If they don&amp;rsquo;t, consumers would be less likely to use their product, making it less valuable to advertisers.
60 Minutes presented a segment back in 2018 titled &amp;ldquo;Brain Hacking&amp;rdquo; (link) that explained how intentional these addictive features are.
The NIH published an article in 2019, listing several common &amp;ldquo;psychological mechanisms&amp;rdquo; that are built into social media and other smartphone apps (link).</description>

      <description>I constantly think of software, data, and other technical components of my job in terms of analogies. It&amp;rsquo;s a great teaching mechanism, particularly for visual learners such as myself.
Analogies have greatly impacted terminology in software for a long time. Data pipelines are so named as information &amp;ldquo;flows&amp;rdquo; from a source to a destination. Neural networks, and their building blocks called perceptrons, are named after neurological terminology since the design of these structures was inspired by the brain.</description>

      <description>Decision making should remain with people. Data gathering, analysis, and even recommendations may (and in many cases, should) fall to technology, including AI, but people should always be the one to pull the trigger - metaphorically and certainly literally.
Business idea: the differentiating factor for Frakes, Inc. is that we will always reserve the right to revoke our customers&#39; rights. Obviously this is not because we&amp;rsquo;d ever want to, but because we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be like Apple.</description>

      <description>UI has an innate ability to instill a variety of emotions in users. A dashboard full of green-background rows invokes satisfaction. A single red exclamation mark icon amidst a sea of green checkmarks should draw attention to itself like a bad spy behind enemy lines and serve as a nuisance to the user like a popcorn kernel stuck in their gums.
Bad passwords, old passwords, and re-used passwords SHOULD bother users.</description>

      <description>Everything now is data-driven. E-commerce vendors that can&amp;rsquo;t accurately make personalized product recommendations will inevitably fail to compete with those that can. Successful political campaigns rely on polling data and other quantified public sentiment in order to determine into which states and demographics are worth investing time and money.
This is not a new phenomenon: only a new buzzword.
&amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; is just information. Commercial enterprises have always needed to know what products are worth building and what services are worth offering.</description>

      <description>Most companies and products have their own &amp;ldquo;tech stack&amp;rdquo; or list of technologies they use in their proprietary tools. As a pro user, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for ways to enable the most capabilities, speed up my workflow, and - ideally - find free ways to do so.

      <description>Exploring the magic black box of .git
What happened and when? When something breaks, and you have no idea where to start, try a manual binary search through the git log.
 something is currently broken we don&amp;rsquo;t know when it broke / when it last worked  What to do
 git log --pretty=format:&amp;quot;%ci | %h&amp;quot; --no-merges -- tools/ui-ide/package.json Start at middle commit ID check out commit ID and run whatever idempotent script you need to put comment next to commit ID If it works, pick commit ID halfway between that one and last-tried future commit (or latest commit) If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, pick commit ID halfway between that one and last-tried past commit (or first commit) Repeat from step 3 with new commit ID  Once this is done, you&amp;rsquo;ll have determined which commit ID broke everything and you can blame the developer who created that commit</description>

      <description>Billions of dollars have been invested in building robust AI models to recommend e-commerce products customers are more likely to buy based on their individual shopping history. Say you&amp;rsquo;ve, like me, shopped for computer and fitness gear in the past. Amazon&amp;rsquo;s algorithm will probably suggest a set of Beats Pro headphones at some point.
Of all the headphones out there, though, why did Amazon choose that particular product to show you?</description>

      <description>I have way too many browser bookmarks, but there is one folder of bookmarks I use regularly: bookmarklets.
Just as you can save an HTML webpage as a bookmark, you can also save Javascript script as a bookmarklet, basically turning your bookmarks bar into a control panel.
javascript:(function(){alert(&amp;#39;hello!&amp;#39;)})() caption: a very basic javascript snippet
Caution: make sure you know exactly what the bookmarklet is going to do before you run it or add it to your bookmarks bar.</description>

      <description>If I ran the zoo&amp;hellip; Knowledge sharing is difficult. Everywhere. And it&amp;rsquo;s because everyone, EVERYONE, writes their own &amp;ldquo;notes to self,&amp;rdquo; bookmarked links, and custom local &amp;ldquo;one-off&amp;rdquo; scripts.
 Can&amp;rsquo;t we just have them put those on Confluence/Wiki/Teams/Slack/GitHub/Community/code documentation/Sharepoint?
 First off, pick a damn &amp;ldquo;single source of truth,&amp;rdquo; you can&amp;rsquo;t have 12 of them.
Secondly, we could try, but no one will. That stems from much more deeply-seated problems: impostor syndrome, self-doubt, and fear of judgment.</description>

      <description>I was watching a presentation by QuantumBlack, a technology company touting itself as an advocate of &amp;ldquo;augmented intelligence&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;artificial intelligence,&amp;rdquo; at the Royal Institution (link). In it, Martha Imprialou talks about some of the tragedies of poorly-executed implementations of machine learning in our world with a slide titled &amp;ldquo;When machine learning fails to deliver.&amp;rdquo;
The three examples given were:
 A self-driving Uber car hit and killed a pedestrian Amazon&amp;rsquo;s one-day delivery service area excluded ~50% of the black population in Chicago Google&amp;rsquo;s sentiment analyzer rated the terms &amp;ldquo;Jew&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;homosexual&amp;rdquo; negatively  All three of these incidents are, at best, unfortunate and, at worst, tragedies.</description>

      <description>Sabbatical Plan I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break from full-time work for at least a few weeks, probably a few months.
While we&amp;rsquo;re far from early retirement, Christina and I have saved enough money to support this temporary venture into voluntary unemployment. And based on the current demand for experienced professionals in both our respective fields, we are confident that both of us will find suitable and profitable work when we choose to pursue it, barring an economic paradigm shift large enough to displace other skilled workers who hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken a sabbatical.</description>

Average tenure at companies is decreasing, especially in tech
Huge demand for tech talent
Why the disconnect?
Theory: tech expectations are too high
Look at job listings. Jobs require half a decade of experience in Docker, Linux, JS, React, Node, everything
What if we applied Unix philosophy to our job market?
Do one thing and do it well
Stop hiring full-stack, do-everything, superstar rockstar ninjas
Hire experts at one thing</description>
