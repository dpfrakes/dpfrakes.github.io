I was reading an article about a recent development in the world of
supercomputing, in which a new technology called a "photonic coprocessor" was
successfully integrated in one of the world's most powerful computers in the
world.

Perhaps it was discussing the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope
with my father-in-law and the subsequent disagreement we had over the
significance of such an endeavor, but this article inspired me to consider
what other cutting-edge advancements of our species are worthy of my attention
and investment.

The Tech Radar article's image is a photograph of the supercomputer which
includes an exhibit-like exterior, portraying the face of Jean Zay, a French
politician of whom I'd never heard before learning of this supercomputer's
existence.

As I develop my ever-growing to-do list of books to read, languages to learn,
and projects to tackle, I've become increasingly aware of how futile these
ventures truly are. There will always be more books than I could ever read,
more websites than I could ever access, more skills than I could ever learn,
more places than I could ever visit.

Ecclesiastes is one of my, if not my absolute, favorite books of the Bible.
While "nihilistic" may not be an entirely accurate label for Solomon's
sentiments, his writings share themes of meaninglessness in life:

* 1:1-11  Everything is Meaningless
* 1:12-18 Wisdom is Meaningless
* 2:1-11  Pleasures are Meaningless
* 2:12-16 Wisdom and Folly are Meaningless
* 2:17-26 Toil is Meaningless
* 4:13-16 Advancement is Meaningless
* 5:8-20  Riches are Meaningless

How many Nobel Prize winners can you name? I doubt it's anywhere near all 892.
The Christian church established All Saints' Day because there were too many
martyrs to remember. Personally, I couldn't even give you the first names of
all - or, in fact, most - of my great-grandparents.

So what do we do with this knowledge that our work, our life, our family, our
contributions will all soon be forgotten? Enjoy your life! Treat it like any
other gift: Something you never needed, something never would have gotten
yourself, something extra. While it is unnecessary, our life on Earth should
not be squandered but enjoyed:

> so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.
>
> Ephesians 6:3

Ackowledge and appreciate the abilities and time God has given you, whatever
and however much they may be. And most importantly, remain focused on the life
that matters most: your eternal life.
