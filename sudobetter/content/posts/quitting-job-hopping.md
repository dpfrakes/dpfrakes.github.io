It depends on who you ask, but personally, I consider myself a bit of a
job-hopper. I've held full-time positions at 5 companies (6 if you count my
transfer from company #2 to its subsidiary energy company) with an average
tenure of just over 21 months at each employer. Seeing as how the typical
software engineer [stays at a company for an average of two years](https://developerpitstop.com/how-long-do-software-engineers-stay-at-a-job/),
I'm actually pretty average when it comes to job-hoppiness.

However, my home life has changed drastically from when I was 22 (I have a
wife, a son, a dog, a mortgage), and my career goals have changed as a
result of both my responsibilities as the bread-winner for my family as well
as my experience thus far working in tech. I enjoy being a big fish in a small
pond: I like knowing what to do and being a strong team member upon whom my
teammates can rely. Job-hopping has introduced me to far more technologies
than I would've discovered on my own, but that also means I haven't had a
chance to master any one of them.

After college, I stuck with learning Java as it was the first language I
learned and I saw many job listings for Java developers. Accenture hired me
for those skills, and I continued to learn Java there on top of Oracle SQL,
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bash, and a bit of Informatica.

At Blackstone, I learned about the world of hybrid mobile applications using
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Apache Cordova. We also dabbled in PHP, and later,
when I was transfered to Blackstone's subsidiary, Trellis, I dove back into
Java along with a jQuery front end.

My team at Celerity was a "Django shop," so I quickly learned Python, Django,
Celery, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary, a bit of AWS, and the ins and outs of
designing a custom content management system (CMS).

C3 AI was a completely different world for me: a proprietary software suite,
a billionaire CEO, a headline-making IPO while I was there, and a break-neck
pace for projects and tooling. It was a whirlwind, and I learned a lot, but
my home life suffered, so I left after my initial shares vested.

Now I'm at Paradyme as a result of a corporate connection between my old
boss's boss at C3 and the Chief Growth Officer and co-founder of Paradyme.
I can't help but think I didn't earn my spot here, but I'm grateful for the
opportunity and trust that these executives from two reputable companies have
placed in me.

But holy cow, the number of technologies that my new team use on a day-to-day
basis is mind-boggling. I'd heard of and learned the bare basics (or more
accurately, "general intuition") of a few: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and
Spring. However, the vast majority are all new, and those that aren't brand
new, I've still nowhere near mastered: Istio, Grafana, Loki, Prometheus,
Kafka, fluentd, Elasticsearch, Quay, SonarQube, Argo CD, Buildah, Terraform,
Helm, Zookeeper, etcd, JMeter, Groovy, Cucumber, Strimzi, Jaeger, and I'm sure
I'm missing several more.

I still struggle with the question of "what I want to be (or do) when I grow
up," mostly because there are so many options just within the realm of
software engineering. I want to stick it out where I am now for at _least_ 2
years, hopefully longer, but I know I will continually revisit my own goals;
professional, personal, and financial.
