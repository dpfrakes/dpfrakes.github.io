Family can be exhausting. Parents bicker, siblings fight, grandparents rant,
and toddlers never run out of energy.

## Coping

1. Recognize how you're feeling

It's okay to be drained, angry, offended, sad, disappointed, or upset without
feeling guilty. (It's also okay to feel guilty, but not because of other
emotions.)

2. Figure out what's causing it

Really give this some time. There may be a very clear cause, but if you feel
your blood pressure rising just thinking about answering out loud, and you
wouldn't feel satisfied with your answer unless you shouted it, then your mind
is not clear enough to honestly and thoroughly complete this step.

3. Cool off

Count to 10, take a shower, go for a walk, or even sleep on it. Just give
yourself an appropriate amount of time where you won't say something you
regret or rile yourself up.

4. Pray on it

Once you've relaxed and spent enough time away from whatever was inducing your
stress, ask God for patience, peace, and humility. Remember that you are no
better than anyone (Romans 3:23), and that you are called to treat all people
with love (Matthew 25:45).

5. Forgive and forget

Forgiveness may not even be necessary if the cause of stress is a personal
problem, as is often the case with family. I'm blessed with a supportive and
loving family on both sides, and I struggle to recollect an instance where ill
will or nefarious behavior was ever a relevant concern. Regardless, learn what
you can from your experiences and move on.
