I don't listen to the radio very often anymore. Typically short car rides are
accompanied by conversation with my wife, other times tech podcasts fill the
space, and sometimes silence. But on occasion, I flip on the local Christian
radio station that I used to leave on all the time. My brain seems to be
recalling a particular song for me repeatedly as of late: Breathe by Johnny
Diaz.

> Alarm clock screaming bare feet hit the floor \
> It's off to the races everybody out the door \
> I'm feeling like I'm falling behind, it's a crazy life \
> Ninety miles an hour going fast as I can \
> Trying to push a little harder trying to get the upper hand \
> So much to do in so little time, it's a crazy life \
> It's ready, set, go it's another wild day \
> When the stress is on the rise in my heart I feel You say just
> 
> (chorus) \
> Breathe, just breathe \
> Come and rest at My feet \
> And be, just be \
> Chaos calls but all you really need \
> Is to just breathe
> 
> Third cup of joe just to get me through the day \
> Wanna make the most of time but I feel it slip away \
> I wonder if there's something more to this crazy life \
> I'm busy, busy, busy, and it's no surprise to see \
> That I only have time for me, me, me \
> There's gotta be something more to this crazy life \
> I'm hanging on tight to another wild day \
> When it starts to fall apart in my heart I hear You say just

Every single line is relatable, and I'm ashamed that that is the case. Then
again, it is easy to constantly feel ashamed when you believe mankind is
inherently sinful, which I do.

I don't recall a time in my life when I had more "things" going on all at
once. On paper, it seems quite normal and manageable: I have a family of 3,
I work as a software engineer, and I volunteer at my church.

But my workplace is pushing me to do well over 40 hours of work each week by
setting unrealistic goals and arbitrary deadlines. My company also hired me
with the explicit intention of having me work with a company I happily left
just prior to taking this position (that's a whole other story, but TL;DR is
`#thanksCOVID`). My volunteer position at church is as a School Board member
for our parish school. Not only had my wife and I joined this church without
our awareness of the school, but we also had no experience or even awareness
of classical education. When we married, I always figured we'd send our kids
to public school, same as us and 90% of the US.

My mother-in-law is sick. My dog died. My job routinely burns me out. Our
church school has fallen apart in less than 6 months. Our church is divided as
as result of the school crisis (or possibly vice versa, I can't tell). I've
essentially taken on a second job as "classical Lutheran educator recruiter"
with no idea what these teachers' day-to-day life would look like.

I'm currently writing this post in my father-in-law's library, where I set up
to work on weekdays while we visit. My son, along with his mom, cousins,
aunts, and grandparents, is playing in the pool outside the window.

I want to throw in the towel and give up on everything but my family. I work
from home and I still miss them.
