# Sabbatical Plan

I'm taking a break from full-time work for at least a few weeks, probably a few months.

While we're far from early retirement, Christina and I have saved enough money to support this temporary venture into voluntary unemployment. And based on the current demand for experienced professionals in both our respective fields, we are confident that both of us will find suitable and profitable work when we choose to pursue it, barring an economic paradigm shift large enough to displace other skilled workers who hadn't taken a sabbatical.

## Reasons

Reflecting on my career as a software engineer / technical consultant / systems analyst / forward deployed engineer (in addition to the many other hats worn while holding said offices, including manager, technical lead, salesman, customer support, dev ops specialist, and recruiter), every position has tasked me with plenty of work, most of which, I would argue, was outside the scope of my intended career trajectory. Some combination of my fiercely non-confrontational personality and my genuine desire to be a valuable asset has led me to repeatedly comply with this tasking. It wasn't until recently, however, that I realized these tasks comprise a significant portion, if not a majority, of my career.

I recognize that I'm not alone in my desire for a clearer mission definition for my life. It's difficult to justify characterizing this need as a crisis, however, possibly because it is a common aspiration. But the ubiquity of this need to reflect, recharge, and re-align with one's own values doesn't detract from its importance.

## Goals

I have learned much more than I could have imagined from my colleagues, peers, bosses, and subordinates over the course of my career, and I have learned that I am a naturally curious and motivated student, given the right environment. My hope in taking this sabbatical is not only to address a long laundry list of project ideas to explore, books to read, and chores to do, but also to meditate on what kind of life I want to lead and where I should align myself so that the skills I learn from my surroundings align with that bigger picture.

### Tasks

A tentative list of things I want to accomplish:

* Develop good sleeping habits
  * Go to bed at a relatively consistent time
  * Sleep for 7-8 hours every night
  * Wake up at a respectable time without an alarm clock
* Develop good personal health habits
  * Shower once a day
  * Brush teeth and floss twice a day
  * Exercise 3-5x per week
  * Drink adequate water daily
* Develop good spiritual habits
  * Pray every morning before coffee and every night before bed
  * Read a different scripture passage daily
  * Memorize 1 Bible passage per week
  * Read and reflect on the Small Catechism
* Read
  * Prioritize reading list
  * Read daily; 2 books / 300 pages per week
* Pursue personal projects
  * Consolidate and organize ideas
  * Ideate on feasibility of most interesting projects
  * Build a project, start to finish - if applicable, publish/deploy it
* Minimalize
  * Organize and take inventory of all possessions
  * Donate or throw out enough stuff so as to make every room feel clutter-free
  * Explore options to sustainably steward sentimental items and heirlooms
* Address to do list
  * Don't finish everything: just those tasks that are urgent, important, or overdue
  * Complete enough tasks to accept the unfinished backlog as reasonable debt

## Thoughts

As I look at this drafted preliminary list, it occurs to me that this list of 7 items, each with its own list of steps or criteria for success, appears daunting. The list takes up my entire computer screen, addresses my most important life values, and time and again, I've re-committed to one or more of these habit-building challenges, only to relapse into a far less ideal lifestyle. And yet, steps toward each of these tasks can be taken every day with plenty of time to spare.

It is a depressing visualization: a calendar with blocks of time allotted to work overgrowing like weeds, overtaking less urgent time allocations, including social outings, family events, evenings, weekends, and even mealtimes. My garden is overgrown with weeds, and I haven't committed to continually weeding and pruning to protect the plants that bear fruit. It's time to start weeding.
