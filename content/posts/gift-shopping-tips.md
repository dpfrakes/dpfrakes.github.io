### Treat Automated Suggestions as Trailheads

Billions of dollars have been invested in building robust AI models to recommend e-commerce products customers are more likely to buy based on their individual shopping history. Say you've, like me, shopped for computer and fitness gear in the past. Amazon's algorithm will probably suggest a set of Beats Pro headphones at some point.

Of all the headphones out there, though, why did Amazon choose that particular product to show you? A few possible reasons:

1. They own that brand
2. They have a partnership with that brand/company
3. It's one of the highest profit margin products in its category
4. It's a product you've already viewed
5. It has the most 4- and 5-star Amazon reviews, which have been repeatedly proven to be unreliable

6. It's junk they're trying to get rid of (Prime Day has come along way, but I'm)
