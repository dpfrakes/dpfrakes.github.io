Personal projects are arguably the best way to improve a variety of skills.
For data-centric projects, those skills including scraping, managing,
transforming, processing, analyzing, and visualizing data, to name a few of
those skills. However, those skills are not the categories to which this post
is referring, because all polished projects should include several, if not
all, of these domains.

In deciding what project to design and execute, I've found it helpful to think
in terms of the type of data you would use and the type of real-world impact
the final product would have.
