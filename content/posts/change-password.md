UI has an innate ability to instill a variety of emotions in users. A dashboard
full of green-background rows invokes satisfaction. A single red exclamation
mark icon amidst a sea of green checkmarks should draw attention to itself like
a bad spy behind enemy lines and serve as a nuisance to the user like a popcorn
kernel stuck in their gums.

Bad passwords, old passwords, and re-used passwords SHOULD bother users.

## What TODO about it

Create python/bash script to query password manager API for old/bad passwords.
Add script to cron job/terminal startup to display a message + link to update.
