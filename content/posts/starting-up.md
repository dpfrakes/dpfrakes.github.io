## Reflect

What's important to you?
What is prevalent in your daily or weekly life that takes up more time or cognitive load than it should?

## Pick a Problem

If you were the one working on the most promising solution to a problem, what problem would it need to be?
What would happily keep you working on a solution late into the night?
What would make you want to still get out of bed early the next morning to keep working?

## Pick Your Weight Class

What is the scope of your impact?
How many people's lives could be improved (by demography, interests, gender, politics, and other demographic delineators)?
Who would you be competing against when you are ready to sell it? Don't fight Google with your v1.0.

## Set Milestones

Start at the end: what will the final product be able to do?
Work backwards: what are some major features or steps that would get to that final product?
Verify veracity: will it solve or mitigate the problem you picked?

## Hold Yourself Accountable

Advertise your project and release date.
Tell your friends and family, then encourage them to keep asking you about the status

## Do It

Just build it.

## Sell It

Hire help: TODO I can't find the post I read a while back, but it was written by an indie developer
who launched a product, saw steady but minimal income, hired a marketing manager, and saw monthly
recurring revenue take off immediately. Impressive line chart, wish I could find the post...
