The anti-work movement is a selfish and dangerous one that demands a better
deal for employees at the expense of the founder of the feast. Whether or not
the entrepreneurs, founders, and employers "need" all the money they acquire,
a deal was agreed upon between these businesspeople and their employees.

If the business idea is good, consumers will pay for the company's goods or
services. If the employer develops a sufficient workforce, the goods or
services can continue to be produced. If an employee decides to become part of
that workforce, and the employer decides he or she is qualified, they sign a
contract where they both agree on a price for the _employee's_ services.

Every interaction is an agreement between two parties:

* Consumers agree to pay a certain price for a company's goods or services
* Companies agree to provide that good or service for that price
* Employers agree to pay a certain price for employees' services
* Employees agree to provide those services for that price

When employees demand more compensation than the amount to which they they
originally agreed, they are not holding up their end of the deal and are at
fault. The parable of the workers in the vineyard in Matthew 20 describes this
very situation quite clearly.

> "The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each
> received a denarius. So when those came who were hired first, they expected
> to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. When they
> received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 'These who were
> hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal
> to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'
> 
> "But he answered one of them, 'I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn't
> you agree to work for a denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give the
> one who was hired last the same as I gave you. Don't I have the right to do
> what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?'"

> Matthew 20:9-15

This isn't even a lesson in "the world's not fair, get over it." In fact, this
parable explains that everything that occurred _was_ fair: an agreement was
made between the landowner and each of the workers. The only reason for
complaint was raised when the employees who agreed to work a full day for a
denarius saw someone else get paid a higher hourly rate.

Now, this parable does not include anything about injustice, unethical
business practices, or other workplace offenses that do occur in the real
world. Forced labor, embezzlement, lying, and many other offenses sadly
permeate a considerable portion of the business world. This is where law,
journalism, and vigilant consumer research work to reveal these wrongdoings
and prosecute offenders accordingly.

However, when no agreement has been violated and no injustices committed, we
have the ability to weigh all the pros and cons, then agree or disagree with
the terms of employment as workers (or terms of sale as consumers). And if,
after we do our due diligence, choose to work for a particular business or
person, we should do so without complaining:

> Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless
> and pure, "children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation."
>
> Philippians 2:14
