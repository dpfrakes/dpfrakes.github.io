WFH - levels the playing field for all employees (those already 100% remote and those having to switch to a new operating environment)

* Electoral college consideration:
  * 2 employees remote + 18 in office = 2 demographic groups (10/90 popular vote, 50/50 representative vote)

Ideal team size

* Create hierarchy such that teams at each level (nuclear families + head node/team lead) are approximately the same size
* Make it so at every level of the org tree (all head nodes/team leads = new nuclear family with new head/lead manager)
