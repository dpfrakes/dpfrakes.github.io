Since the widespread adoption of social media, disagreements between friends
and neighbors have become more aggressive, public, and divisive. The internet
provides anonymity to those who might otherwise behave so reserved as to not
engage in confrontation at all. Comment threads provide a platform on which
complete strangers may join the fray, regardless of qualifications and always
unprovoked, as allies or enemies.

Recent events in US history have acted as fuel for this fire (e.g.
presidential election results, media bias, pandemics and proceeding
legislature), but the initial catalyst for this blaze most certainly predates
all of these.

## A Strategic Approach

Imagine you and your opponent on a field:

```

  X (Opponent)

                           Y (You)

```

Somewhere between you exist at least one fissure, that is, one fundamental
difference that prevents you from agreeing with their standpoint and vice
versa:

```
             \
  X           |
             /
            |              Y
           /
```

To win the argument, you must walk your opponent from his position to yours.
To do this, you must start off by either (a) finding common ground, or (b)
make an assumption

1. Find initial common ground
2. Make an assumption

```

  X

                           Y

```


```

  X

                           Y

```



### Define Assertions

When engaging in an argument over a specific topic, it's important to first
understand where each party stands. What do you believe to be true? What does
the other party believe to be true?

> A: I believe the COVID mandate is wrong.
> B: What COVID mandate? By what authority? To which people?
> A: I believe it is wrong for the federal government to require private
>    businesses to require vaccination as a condition of employment.
> B: Wrong how? Is it immoral? Illegal? Both?
> A: Both. Immoral 

### Establish Starting Point

Let's assume the best vaccine we have is 5% effective in preventing COVID, 5%
effective in preventing severe cases/hospitalizations, and 5% effective in
preventing deaths from COVID. Would you take it? Probably not.

Okay, now let's assume this vaccine is 95% effective against COVID in all the
same respects. Now would you take it? Probably.

So we can conclude that there exists some number between 0 and 100 at which
you prefer to get vaccinated.

Let's say, for the sake of argument, that that number is 75%. In other words,
if a vaccine is 75% effective, you'd take it. If it's less than 75%, you'd
pass. You can even consider a sigmoid curve to reflect vaccine confidence as a
function of efficacy.

Now what if you were barred from employment because the vaccine was 55%
effective and the government's threshold was 50%.

## Disagreeing in Real Time

For the purposes of this writing, a successful conversation is one in which
all participating parties are able to (1) have communicated their viewpoint
as thoroughly as their expertise on the subject discussed enables them and (2)
walk away without new enmity toward any other party.

Discussing disagreements in person, civilly, is certainly favorable to any
conversation conducted through an intermediary, be it an online forum or a
messenger. Body language accounts for approximately 90% of the communication
that occurs between people, whereas minute aspects of conversation online such
as time between messages is a scalar and meaningless metric, and emojis
provide a multiple choice excuse to encapsulate the vast scope of human
emotion.

## Disagreeing Asynchronously

Some parties have taken to undemocratic approaches to quell the chaos in the
name of promoting the general welfare. Examples include YouTube and Facebook
flagging and removing user content that spreads misinformation about vaccines.
As private businesses, it is entirely within their rights to ban content for a
variety of reasons, not least of which being that leaders within or moderators
employed by the company simply dislike certain content.

The problem arises when these technology companies becomes so prevalent and
ubiquitous that an entire generation of humans replace community, a concept
that predates humanity and differentiates intelligent life from all other
creation, with a proprietary software application. At that point, civic
regulation is a necessity to prevent not only a business monopoly, but a
cultural one.

## Options

If all has been said and no party has been convinced of an opposing argument,
there are a limited number of ways each person can choose to proceed:

1. Agree to disagree

You may be open to discuss this topic again in the future or not, but for now,
continue living according to your principles, knowing that there are people
who oppose your viewpoint and may live according to _their_ principles, which,
depending on the disagreement, may cause continued friction until consensus is
achieved or another option is chosen.

2. Keep Fighting

Rarely a good choice, continue the argument without new evidence to support
your view. The only ways this would be fruitful are if (1) your opponent can be
genuinely bullied into submission or (2) it is better to drive your opponent
away than accept that they believe differently.

3. Separate

Another typically poor avenue, you can physically separate yourself from your
opponent. This may or may not include terms for reconnection, in which case
the ultimatum itself would almost always irreparably damage the relationship
regardless of whether reconnection was established.



## How I See The Argument Going

The government should not get to decide what I put in my body.

    If your decision affects other citizens, the government has a
    responsibility to promote the general welfare.

> Fundamental disagreement: the threshold at which personal liberty is
> sacrificed for the common welfare.

COVID has a 1% mortality rate, which is mostly those 65 and older. The
vaccines are less than a year old, and even the leading "expert" has changed
his message on what is safe, what is 

    It's new, highly contagious, causes hospitalizations and death, and we
    don't know the extent to which it causes long term effects. The vaccines,
    on the other hand, use proven mRNA technology, have a high efficacy rate
    and a low chance of severe adverse effects.

"Side effects may include"

These pharmaceutical ads are for treatments to diseases people already have
which are not contagious, at least to the extent COVID is.

"Flu shot"
"Cars and alcohol"
