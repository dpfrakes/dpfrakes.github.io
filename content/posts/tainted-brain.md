I want to do more research into this to avoid reinventing the wheel, because I
am certain that someone far more intelligent than me has already beat me to
the discovery and subsequent phrase-coining of the phenomenon, but while
studying for a professional certification, I realized that my pre-existing way
of thinking may be preventing me from easily understanding new concepts whose
nature does not lend itself to similar axioms, metaphors, or explanations;
and other - equally or more complicated - concepts related to software come
quite naturally to me while eluding others.

The catalyst for this thought was a lesson in network interfaces on systems
running Linux-based operating systems. The concept of networks is simple.
Mathematically: a network is a group of nodes connected by edges to form a
graph. But I struggle to understand the depth of knowledge required to assert
proficiency in "understanding" network interfaces.

From the Linux Foundation:

> Network interfaces are a connection channel between a device and a network.
> Physically, network interfaces can proceed through a network interface card
> (NIC), or can be more abstractly implemented as software.

How can something be implemented by software that can also be implemented
without it? My software-focused brain cannot answer intelligently.

In order to answer that question, I would feel obligated to also explain the
physics of the movement of electrons through specific material (hardware) in a
controlled manner, which seems like an excessively scientific explanation of a
network interface than others would probably like.

How do I change the way that I think on a temporary basis? Can I switch my
software engineer brain off and substitute in another cartridge? Are there
negative side effects of doing so?
