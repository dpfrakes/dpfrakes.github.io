It's no secret that remote work is a normal, ubiquitous feature of our world's
21st century economy. While 30 years ago, the idea that a company would offer
a telework option to its employees would have defined the image of that
company. Regardless of whether it was a services or product company, whether
it was a finance or an energy company, if it had 10 employees or 1,000, what
it might have been known for was simply its novel telework model.

Now, a common question - if not the first question - often asked to people
sharing news of a new job is: "is it remote-friendly?" Crazy.

But not all "remote-friendly" companies actually know how to thrive, or even
get by, while its workforce is scattered throughout the nation (or world).

Time to revisit "High Output Management."

Engaging with colleagues and subordinates was challenging enough in this
pre-digital world. The nature of the challenges back then hasn't changed:
humans still have conflicting beliefs, behaviors, preferences, and methods of
communication and work.

Add to these challenges the problems that a remote world introduces and you
have a real culture problem to address.
