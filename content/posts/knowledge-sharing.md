# If I ran the zoo...

Knowledge sharing is difficult. Everywhere. And it's because everyone, EVERYONE, writes their own "notes to self," bookmarked links, and custom local "one-off" scripts.

First off, pick a damn "single source of truth," you can't have 12 of them.

Secondly, we could try, but no one will. That stems from much more deeply-seated problems: impostor syndrome, self-doubt, and fear of judgment. And if psychologists, authors, teachers, and parents haven't figured out a universal solution for this very normal human condition, a software company sure as shit won't.

I propose a new system wherein all teammates write. They can be short blog posts. They can be 20-page opinion pieces. They can be a 3-line Javascript snippet with a comment explaining what it does. But they should all be on the same platform.

Build a reliable aggregator for a "single endpoint for truth" where people can search all these posts
