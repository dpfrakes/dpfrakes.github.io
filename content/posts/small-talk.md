I just got off a call with my boss. I typically feel very stressed whenever
these calls happen; not because my boss is hard on me (he's most definitely
not), but because I feel anxious that I usually have nothing to offer, which
is especially anxiety-inducing when these calls are spontaneously scheduled.

My boss, though, starts off these 1:1 calls with small talk, which he usually
doesn't do on large group meetings. I've had a lot of colleagues (superiors,
bosses, peers, subordinates) participate in small talk during calls: it's
nothing new. But it struck me for the first time as "important" today.

I work 100% remote. I've worked at this company for almost a year now, and
I've never met anyone in my company in person, despite the fact that our
office is less than an hour away, along with most of my coworkers. I prefer
remote work, especially now that I have a baby, but it does detract from the
feeling of camaraderie I've felt at other companies where I went into the
office, even part-time.

This is actually the first 100% remote company I've worked for, now that I
think about it. Celerity was 80% remote (I went into DC on Mondays), and that
was the first company I had any telework capabilities (unless you count my
first job out of college where I worked 40 hours in DC and then extra hours
from home or vacation).

Anyway, back to the topic of small talk.

My boss asked me about my kid, we commiserated about both getting COVID from
traveling, and we just spent 5 or so minutes chatting about non-work-related
stuff. This really helped my anxiety, and I think it's for two reasons:

1. If there was something urgent, we wouldn't have time for small talk. That
   means nothing is urgent, nothing is wrong, everything is okay.
2. If the CTO of a company can choose to spend a few minutes talking about
   non-work-related stuff, certainly it's not a crime for his subordinate with
   a lower bill rate and less to do to participate too.

I'm still not defending quiet quitters or people who small talk for the
majority of their work day, but I may be feeling a little softer when it comes
to small talk because it's not killing time: it's spending time effectively,
building trust, opening communication, and leading by example by illustrating
that it's okay to be human on the clock.
