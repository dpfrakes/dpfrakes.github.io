## Practice is a Lost Art

My Dad has a fairly cynical sense of humor which is likely the source of his
interest in "trollable" axioms. Once such perverted proverb: "If at first you
don't succeed, skydiving may not be for you." Indeed, there are certain fields
for which on-the-job practice is not an afforded luxury. But when you think of
it, practice is not suspended when you perform. Performance, itself, is an
experience from which one learns; same as a training session, classroom
lecture, or an hour of practicing scales alone in a practice room.

You might start coding in a high school or college classroom, but when you
build and deploy production code, you're still practicing. Don't overlook this
very necessary and significant phenomenon.

## Unrealistic Expectations

Moore's Law. The singularity. iPhone release schedule.

Technology, and the ubiquity of software in particular, is advancing at an
astonishingly fast pace. (Sadly, the quality of software and appropriate
legislation regarding it are moving at a significantly slower rate, but that's
a post for another day.)

For those unfamiliar with the singularity:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity

I remember working for a client on a custom content management system and
mobile-friendly website. I was working on the search functionality, which
required an autocomplete-populated dropdown of the first 5 relevant articles
published on the site. So I added the search bar, installed an autocomplete
plugin, tuned the elasticsearch weights, built the index, and styled a limited
dropdown with a performant debounce. When I presented this to the client, he
asked why he couldn't use the arrow keys on his keyboard to navigate to one
of the autocomplete results.

Requirements gathering is hard, and the ubiquity of the world's best software
companies permeating every hour of our lives means that the public's
expectations are set by the elite developers, architects, and visionaries of
this decade. Buzzwords like "customized," "tailored," and "intelligent" imply
that code not explicitly included in a contract should not only be included,
but perform comparably to Big Tech.

## False Promises

While it's tempting to go straight to YouTube and "Learn Python in 30
Minutes," remember that experiences you create for yourself count for
infinitely more than information you consume. After all, what does it mean to
"learn Python?" I can teach you Python in 5 seconds. Ready?

> print('hello')

Congratulations, you know Python. Granted, this doesn't teach you about
variables, data types, classes, modules, list comprehension, loops, libraries,
logging, PEP, pypi, virtual environments... you get the idea.

I've been using Python for about 5 years, and I'm still discovering new tools,
libraries, use cases, and best practices. Additionally, as stated before, the
development of Python itself is no exception to the ever-accelerating pace of
technology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python#Support.

So when a client demands perfection, demand the time and money required to
practice enough to get there.
