Average tenure at companies is decreasing, especially in tech

Huge demand for tech talent

Why the disconnect?

Theory: tech expectations are too high

Look at job listings. Jobs require half a decade of experience in Docker, Linux, JS, React, Node, everything

What if we applied Unix philosophy to our job market?

Do one thing and do it well

Stop hiring full-stack, do-everything, superstar rockstar ninjas

Hire experts at one thing

Look to Ford's production line, separation of duties, efficiency

Easy to determine which position needs more resources

Easier to decide if candidate is qualified
