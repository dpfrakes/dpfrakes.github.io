Think in terms of dollars whenever it matters and percentages when it doesn't.
No matter who you are, what your upbringing was like, how much you make, or
where you are in the world, you are still just as human with the same basic
needs as every single one of your fellow men: Food, clean water, shelter.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy the luxuries of this world:

> There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and tell himself
> that his labor is good. This also I have seen that it is from the hand of
> God.
>
> Ecclesiastes 2:24

If you work for something, you have the right to enjoy the fruits of your
labor. If you marry and have a family, you should rejoice in the companionship
and fellowship you have.

It's important to remember that the permanence and significance of such gifts
are relative. "Family is forever" only within the context of this life we've
been given. It's like an operating system on a computer: the hardware is
useless without an OS running on it, but the computer itself will soon become
obsolete and be thrown away.

A loaf of bread costs 65Â¢ at Aldi. Water is damn near free depending on where
you live. Sufficient shelter isn't cheap but it doesn't need to come with a
parking garage, receptionist, clubhouse
