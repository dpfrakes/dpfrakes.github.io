As our culture becomes increasingly politicized, the industries represented by
some of the most well known celebrities have shifted from actors and
musicians to politicians and executives. Hollywood is going bankrupt while
technology companies make headlines with annual revenues comparable to a
first-world country's GDP.

I confess I was a bit of an "Elon Musk fan boy" when I first heard about him:
An accomplished engineer, a serial entrepreneur, and an idealist always
looking to better the future for mankind. Don't get me wrong, I still have a
lot of respect for a Renaissance man with that kind of vision and grit. But
the more closely you look into any human, the more flaws you see.

## Fun Fact #1: They Will All Be Forgotten

Bill Gates was the richest person on Earth for a long time, and he has done a
lot of good for humanity (granted, only after he acquired his extreme wealth).
Jeff Bezos has proven to have created one of the most successful and forward-
looking business plans in the world, though I don't have anything good to say
about his character.

But do you know who the richest person to have ever lived is? The net worth of
Musk, Gates, and Bezos combined probably couldn't even compare. It could be
the 14th century African emperor Mansa Musa, the 16th century Incan ruler
Atahualpa, or even King Solomon. No one knows, and that's the point.

I'm also a libertarian capitalist and believe that if you worked for and
earned something, you have the right to have it. It doesn't matter if Bezos
has enough money to feed the world three times over: that money came from
customers who chose to give it to him in exchange for his goods and services.
If you'd rather see your money go to the poor and hungry, that's great! Then
give it to the poor and hungry!

Money may not have been the initial motivator for some of these
entrepreneurial giants, but behaviors like
[petty fights on Twitter](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7),
mountains of [lawsuits against each other](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-is-turning-on-one-another-amid-antitrust-probes-and-litigation-2020-09-11),
and a pattern of divorces and broken marriages among them indicate that fame
and fortune are priorities for these men.

Having money is not a sin; but loving money is.

> For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this
> craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves
> with many pangs.
>
> 1 Timothy 6:10

Fame is not a sin either; but pride is.

> Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more
> significant than yourselves.
>
> Philippians 2:3

YouTube constantly pushes recommendations about "software engineer lifestyle"
videos, which often include videos of people talking about the exorbitant
salaries and limitless perks offered to Silicon Valley engineers, and tips and
tricks on how to be successful like Musk, Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, or any
other tech entrepreneur giant.

It's clear to me that those men are not the role models I aspire to emulate.
Not all false idols experience their downfall quickly, or even within their
lifetime.
